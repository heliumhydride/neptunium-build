write a test suite to test every package and feature (/neptunium*/bin/np_test_suite.sh)
fix tar hanging .gz/.xz/... unless we first use zcat/xzcat/...
combine neptunium-base-files with this repo
test build for amd64 using llvm-mingw (+ run test suite)
test build for x86 using llvm-mingw (+ run test suite)
allow build to restart after a build fail (avoids rebuilding and redownloading and reinstalling half of the packages everytime)
general code cleanup
neptunium base files release
add git and 7zip (for self-building support)
add cppcheck + patch from w64devkit maybe
update download urls for packages:
  w64devkit 2.0.0
  busybox-w32 FRP-5467-g9376eebd8
  libarchive 3.7.7
  curl 8.10.1
  libressl 4.0.0
  x64dbg snapshot_2024-10-18_19-09
  llvm-mingw 20241015 (llvm 19.1.2)
  neptunium-base-files w/ release url instead of master head.tar.gz
retest for amd64 after upgraded pkgs
retest for x86 after upgraded pkgs
vim arm64 support
better llvm-mingw building support (for arm64 notably)
test build for arm64
build_vim(): check if running on windows, if so then set UNDER_CYGWIN=no
test self build on amd64, x86, arm64
create a release for neptunium

add armv7 support
when zenithutils is complete, add that to dl_build_install.sh along with mksh/win32 (make an updated, makefile buildable fork) and allow user to choose userland, either busybox-w32 based or zenithutils+mksh based (mksh: make sh.exe alias)
