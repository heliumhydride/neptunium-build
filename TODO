use custom config for busybox and redo busybox_alias_install with new program names (to prevent busybox tar/make/cpio from overtaking libarchive/gmake)
curl https not working (where do we get ssl certificates ?)
remove background cmd when running neptunium.cmd (not neptunium_here.cmd)
use a windows preinstalled font by default for conemu-neptunium.xml (for neptunium-base-files)
test build for amd64
write a test suite to test every package and feature
general code cleanup
neptunium base files release
add git and 7zip
update download urls for packages:
  w64devkit 2.0.0
  busybox-w32 FRP-5467-g9376eebd8
  libarchive 3.7.7
  curl 8.10.1
  libressl 4.0.0
  x64dbg snapshot_2024-10-18_19-09
  llvm-mingw 20241015 (llvm 19.1.2)
  neptunium-base-files w/ release url instead of master head.tar.gz
retest after upgraded pkgs
test build for x86
vim arm64 support
better llvm-mingw building support
test build for arm64
build_vim: check if running on windows, if so then set UNDER_CYGWIN=no
test self build on amd64, x86, arm64
add armv7 support

when zenithutils is complete, add that to dl_build_install.sh along with mksh/win32 (make an updated, makefile buildable fork) and allow user to choose userland, either busybox-w32 based or zenithutils+mksh based
