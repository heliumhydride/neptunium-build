write a test suite to test every package and feature (/neptunium*/bin/np_test_suite.sh)
ctrl-c causes 'Terminate batch script (Y/N)?' and input bugs sometimes
fix tar hanging .gz/.xz/... unless we first use zcat/xzcat/...
test build for amd64 using llvm-mingw (+ run test suite)
test build for x86 using llvm-mingw (+ run test suite)
allow build to restart after a build fail (avoids rebuilding and redownloading and reinstalling half of the packages everytime)
general code cleanup
neptunium base files release
add git and 7zip (for self-building support)
add cppcheck + patch from w64devkit maybe
update download urls for packages:
  w64devkit 2.4.0
  busybox-w32 FRP-5579-g5749feb35
  libarchive 3.8.1
  curl 8.15.0
  libressl 4.1.0
  x64dbg snapshot_2025-08-19_19-40 
  llvm-mingw 20250826 (llvm 21.1.0)
  neptunium-base-files w/ release url instead of master head.tar.gz
retest for amd64 after upgraded pkgs
retest for x86 after upgraded pkgs
vim arm64 support
better llvm-mingw building support (for arm64 notably)
test build for arm64
build_vim(): check if running on windows, if so then set UNDER_CYGWIN=no
test self build on amd64, x86, arm64
create a release for neptunium

add armv7 support
when zenithutils is complete, add that to dl_build_install.sh along with mksh/win32 (make an updated, makefile buildable fork) and allow user to choose userland, either busybox-w32 based or zenithutils+mksh based (mksh: make sh.exe alias)
