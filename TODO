write a test suite to test every package and feature (/neptunium*/bin/np_test_suite.sh)
lldb not working on windows 7, missing dll? (I did install vc runtime)
ctrl-c causes 'Terminate batch script (Y/N)?' and input bugs sometimes
add zlib, zstd, bzip2, lzma for libarchive, could fix bug below in theory
-- fix tar hanging .gz/.xz/... unless we first use zcat/xzcat/...
test build for amd64 using llvm-mingw (+ run test suite)
test build for x86 using llvm-mingw (+ run test suite)
allow build to restart after a build fail (avoids rebuilding and redownloading and reinstalling half of the packages everytime)
general code cleanup
neptunium base files release
self build reqs:
  git and 7zip (required by neptunium)
  perl (required by curl)
  cmake and ninja (required by llvm)
add cppcheck (+ patch from w64devkit maybe?)
update download urls for packages:
  libarchive 3.8.1 (not bumped yet due to Windows 7 not having CreateFile2, which it seems to want for some reason, maybe i set up the build flags wrong for this version?)
  neptunium-base-files w/ release url instead of master head.tar.gz
vim arm64 support
better llvm-mingw building support (for arm64 notably)
test build for arm64
build_vim(): check if running on windows, if so then set UNDER_CYGWIN=no
test self build on amd64, x86, arm64
create a release for neptunium

add armv7 support
when zenithutils is complete, add that to dl_build_install.sh along with mksh/win32 (make an updated, makefile buildable fork) and allow user to choose userland, either busybox-w32 based or zenithutils+mksh based (mksh: make sh.exe alias)
